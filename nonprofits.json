We serve survivors primarily in the Relief and Stabilization phases of recovery. These first two phases of recovery are key in every survivor\u2019s journey to healing. Our goal is to serve as an on-ramp to long-term healing. We do this through 24/7 Survivor Crisis Response, long-term case management, and personalized restoration planning. Once a survivor's basic needs have been met, our team works with them individually to create a restoration plan that fits their specific needs. Each survivor's long-term plan may look a little different depending on their specific needs, but our team is committed to creating a plan that will enable each and every survivor to walk into full freedom. Our goal is to provide a path, clear of obstacles, that enables survivors to walk into full recovery. We cannot walk the path for them, but we can help clear the way.",
